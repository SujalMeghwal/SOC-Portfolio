# Report: USB Malware Suspicious Activity on WIN-7JKBJEGBO38

Date: 3/6/2018  
Analyst: [Your Name]

At around 06:57:48 AM, on system WIN-7JKBJEGBO38, something weird happened that made me think there was malware from a USB device.

---

## üîç Step-by-step what I saw:

### 1. WUDFHost.exe launched right after a USB was connected
- This process is used for user-mode drivers like USB, Bluetooth, MTP, etc.
- It shows up right after the USB got inserted.
- So looks like system trying to load a USB driver for a device.

### 2. Network connection made to 255.255.255.255
- Right after USB plugged in, system tried to talk to 255.255.255.255
- Source IP is local (172.30.1.169) and port is 0 (which is sus)
- This might be malware trying to beacon out or broadcast

### 3. Registry edits happened
- At the same time, registry was edited:
  - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Portable Devices\Devices\...`
  - `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\WpdBusEnumRoot\UMB\...`
- Shows that a SanDisk USB got plugged in
- Looks like malware maybe registering itself or changing something

### 4. RawAccessRead on \Device\HarddiskVolume3
- Multiple RawAccessRead events on the disk
- This is not normal
- Raw access is used to bypass file system permissions and ACLs
- Attackers use this a lot to dump data or mess with the disk directly

### 5. rundll32.exe was launched
- This process was launched at the same second
- Used often by attackers to run payloads
- The command line was weird: `WIN-7JKBJEGBO38\q`
- Looks suspicious and empty

### 6. calc.exe was launched from rundll32.exe
- calc.exe being launched by rundll32.exe is classic test move by malware
- Shows the attacker might be testing execution

### 7. rundll32.exe terminated right after
- So rundll32.exe was short-lived
- Looks like it did its job and exited
- This kind of short behavior is common in malware stagers

## ‚ö†Ô∏è My Analysis

Looks like a USB malware attack. After inserting USB:
- WUDFHost triggers (driver activity)
- Registry changes to register device
- Raw disk access (to maybe read/write without permission)
- Network beacon or broadcast to weird address
- rundll32 launches calc.exe to test execution
- Then it ends
