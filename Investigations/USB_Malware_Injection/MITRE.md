Technique Involved:
T1218.011 – Rundll32: Legitimate Windows utility abused to execute code via DLLs or scripts.
T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: calc.exe could’ve been swapped for PowerShell or another payload.
T1204 – User Execution: Likely via GUI interaction or social engineering.
T1547 – Persistence (if rundll32 was dropped into startup locations, though not shown here).
T1003 and others if followed by credential access.
