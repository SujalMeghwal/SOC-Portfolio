In March 2024, a regional hospital in Lyon, France experienced a ransomware attack that disrupted critical medical services for over 48 hours. The incident began when a hospital employee received a convincing spear-phishing email appearing to come from a medical supplier they regularly interacted with. The email contained a malicious PDF attachment that exploited a vulnerability in the hospital’s default PDF reader software. Once opened, the payload established a reverse shell back to a command-and-control server hosted in Moldova.

The attacker used PowerShell scripts to move laterally across the network, harvesting credentials from memory and establishing persistence by creating new local admin accounts. Within a few hours, the attacker had access to multiple systems, including file servers and patient management platforms. Sensitive patient records were exfiltrated over HTTPS to a VPS located in Russia.

The final stage involved deploying a Black Basta ransomware variant that encrypted over 70% of the hospital’s systems, including MRI scheduling and critical care interfaces. A ransom note demanded €2.5 million in Monero within 96 hours to restore access and prevent the public release of the stolen data. Hospital staff were forced to revert to paper-based systems, and several patient treatments were delayed or redirected to nearby hospitals.
